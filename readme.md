# Raspberry Pi Pico Micrpython studies and experiments

I'm collecting here my studies and experiments about MicroPython on Raspberry Pi Pico. Programming examples and libraries used are located in the [pico](/pico) folder. Read the [pico folder readme](/pico/readme.md) for understanding how examples are organized.

In the [doc folder](/doc) are located datasheets, PDFs, and other things that Raspberry Pi Foundation give for free. I put those docs here for my own ease of use.

The [uf2 folder](/uf2) contains some compiled codes. Upload of those files on the PICO in boot mode will erase the MicroPython interpreter: you can reload it from Thonny IDE.


## My tutorials
I've written some articles on my blog too: are in Italian language but should be translated automatically by your browser since I've installed a plugin that does this. Actually there is those articles:

- [Getting started with MicroPython on Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.settorezero.com/wordpress/raspberry-pi-pico-come-iniziare/)
- [Usage of an OLED display](https://www.settorezero.com/wordpress/raspberry-pi-pico-utilizzare-il-display-oled/)
- [The PWM](https://www.settorezero.com/wordpress/raspberry-pi-pico-gestione-del-pwm-in-micropython/)
