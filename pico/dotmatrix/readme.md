This example was derived form a [work of Fidelius Falcon](https://github.com/FideliusFalcon/rpi_pico_max7219) that uses the [MAX7219 library by Mike Causer](https://github.com/mcauser/micropython-max7219).

I've included the `text_scroll` function by Fidelius Falcon in the MAX7219 library and done some very little edits: read the notes in the MAX7219 library for further informations.
