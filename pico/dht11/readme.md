This example was created thanks to [Elecrow Raspberry Pi Pico Advanced Kit](https://www.elecrow.com/raspberry-pi-pico-advanced-kit-with-pico-board-32-modules-and-32-detailed-projects-lessons.html)  
You can consider this example as a modified version of "Lesson 23 - Mini weather station" included with the Elecrow Kit  
  
Note: DHT11 has a resolution of 1Â°C and 1%RH so you can't get decimals
