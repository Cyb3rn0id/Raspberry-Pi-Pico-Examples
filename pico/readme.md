`_lib` and `_img` folder must be on the Raspberry Pi Pico without the underscore (I've added it only for showing those 2 folder on top of the list).
Examples are contained in each folder grouped for theme, but scripts must be copied on the root of Raspberry Pi Pico, without folders.

Example of Raspberry Pi Pico folder structure:

+--img  
| +--szlogo.pbm  
|  
+--lib  
|  +--max7219.py  
|  +--ssd1306.py  
|  
+--dotmatrix.py  
+--neopixel.py  
+--oled_logo.py  
+--pwm1.py  
+--pwm2.py
